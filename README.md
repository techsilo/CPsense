# 🚨 Illegal Content Detection Software 🚨

## Overview

The **Illegal Content Detection Software** is a robust tool designed to help system administrators detect and manage illegal content on players' and users' personal computers (PCs) in a secure and privacy-conscious manner. This software scans user devices to identify and flag content that violates legal or organizational policies, including unauthorized media files, illicit software, or other prohibited materials.

Ideal for server admins, enterprise environments, or online communities, this tool ensures compliance with legal standards, protects your organization from potential risks, and maintains a safe and secure environment for users. 🌐🔒

## Key Features 🌟

* **Real-Time Scanning**: Continuously scans files and directories for illegal content, with instant alerts when violations are found. 🚨
* **Customizable Detection Rules**: Configure tailored detection rules based on file types, keywords, and specific content categories to suit your needs. ⚙️
* **File Integrity Monitoring**: Tracks file changes over time to detect unauthorized additions, deletions, or modifications. 🔍
* **Remote Scanning**: Perform scans on users' machines over a network, allowing centralized monitoring of multiple devices. 🌍💻
* **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed violation reports with information on detected content and next steps. 📊
* **Non-Intrusive**: Prioritizes user privacy by focusing only on identifying illegal content without accessing sensitive data. 🔐
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems, ensuring broad usability. 💻🍏🐧

## Use Cases 🔒

* **Enterprise Compliance**: Ensure company devices are free from illegal software, pirated media, or any content that might harm the organization's legal standing. 🏢⚖️
* **Online Communities**: Prevent players or users from storing or distributing illegal content (e.g., pirated software, inappropriate material) on their machines. 🎮🛑
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Help organizations meet legal requirements for handling and detecting illegal files across employee or user systems. 📜✅

## Installation 🛠️

### Prerequisites 📋

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Administrative privileges on user machines
* Network access for remote scanning (optional)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techsilo/CPsense
cd CPsense
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Software

To start the software, use this command:

```bash
python main.py
```

For remote scanning or server setups, refer to the **Server Deployment Guide** (detailed below).

## Configuration ⚙️

The software is configurable through the `config.json` file, located in the project’s root directory. Example configuration:

```json
{
  "scan_directories": ["/path/to/scan", "/another/path"],
  "file_types_to_scan": [".exe", ".mp3", ".avi"],
  "illegal_keywords": ["illegal", "pirated", "cracked"],
  "reporting": {
    "enabled": true,
    "report_email": "admin@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

* **scan_directories**: List of directories to scan for illegal content.
* **file_types_to_scan**: File extensions to scan, such as `.exe`, `.mp3`, `.avi`.
* **illegal_keywords**: List of keywords to match within file names or metadata.
* **reporting**: Set to `true` to send email alerts when illegal content is detected.

## Server Deployment Guide 🌐

### Setting Up Remote Scanning

For remote scanning, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy on a central server** with admin privileges.
2. **Configure network settings** to allow communication between the server and client machines (via SSH, RDP, etc.).
3. **Install agents** on client machines or configure remote file access in the `config.json` file.
4. **Enable real-time monitoring** to track and scan files on user machines.

### Automating Scans

You can automate scans using cron jobs (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows). For example, to schedule a daily scan at midnight:

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/main.py --scan
```

#### Windows

1. Open **Task Scheduler** and create a new task.
2. Set the task to run **daily** and execute `python main.py --scan`.

## Reporting & Alerts 📬

Once illegal content is detected, the software will generate a detailed report and send an email notification (if configured). The report will include:

* **File name and location** of the detected content.
* **Violation details**: The nature of the illegal content.
* **Severity level** of the violation.
* **Next steps** for the admin to take action.

### Sample Report

```text
🚨 Illegal Content Detected: 

File: /path/to/file.exe
Violation: Pirated Software
Severity: High
Detected On: 2025-10-29

🔍 Recommendations:
- Immediately remove the file.
- Investigate further for other violations.
```
